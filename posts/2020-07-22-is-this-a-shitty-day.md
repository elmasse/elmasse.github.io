I have read a tweet from Dan Abramov a few days ago. He stated there one sentence that resounded in my head: **Everything feels boring and not worth the effort.** 

The entire tweet is this:

> Overall, I’m lucky to not have many shitty days. When I do, it manifests as not being inspired by anything. Everything feels boring and not worth the effort. Or things that have a straightforward resolution feel blocked with no way forward. Then next day it’s back to normal.

I have been through this so many times that I lost count. It feels really bad. But, lately I started to recognize them as "Shitty days" or "Anxiety issues" and I feel less frustrated although cannot get over it and unfortunately it last a few days.

This is not a post I'd love to share with the world but it helps to write this things down. Hopefully it will help someone else. 

## Am I asking for "What works for You"?

No. Niet. Nope.

This is not a debug problem. Otherwise I'd post it in Stack Overflow. I'm not asking for your opinion.

I hate it when people just reply to it as with Dan's tweet: "It's a bad sleep pattern" -- my brain just yelled "F**K YOU!" -- or "Go for a walk, that works for me..." -- "If that works, then get lost!" -- yeah, my brain again.

For the record, I sleep a solid 8-9 hour a day. Quit smoking almost a year ago. I exercise weekly. I read a lot (in paper). I try to stay away from screens at least 1 hour before going to bed. I started to eat a bit healthy. All these might help, I'm not gonna deny it. I feel overall way better. But these episodes haven't changed much. They feel pretty similar from what can I recall, like, 15 years ago.

But now I recognize the episodes. Writing is some way to unload them from my head. So this seems to help to visualize the problem. Not just hide them once I got back on track and get myself busy with problems to solve. That definitely doesn't help.

## Unlocking

I wrote this in first place for myself. I haven't write any article in my blog for a long long time. And I have like 5 or 6 entries started somewhere.

I do this to help me unlock myself. Trying to overcome a mental lock. 

But, if you made it here, maybe this made you think about yourself. And maybe that helped a bit. Hopefully.
