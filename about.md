Hello, my name is **Maximiliano Fierro**. 

I'm a JavaScript Developer currently living in La Plata, Buenos Aires, Argentina.

I have been working regularly with JavaScript since 2006 but I've been programming since 2001. I'm currently working for [Sencha](http://www.sencha.com) as a JavaScript Developer for Professional Services. I also have experience with Java, Objective C, some C/C++, and a little of Ruby and PHP.

I'm interested in everything related with new technologies, web, JavaScript, IOT (Internet of things) and robotics. 

I help to organize a JavaScript meetup group in La Plata named [LaPlataJS](http://laplatajs.github.io) where we encourage people to share knowledge and experience with JS.
